  "summary": "## Summary\n\nThis commit standardizes git configuration across GitHub Actions workflows by replacing custom Chronicle email addresses with the official GitHub Actions bot credentials:\n\n- **CI Workflow (ci.yml)**: Changed from `ci@chronicle.dev` / \"Chronicle CI\" to the official GitHub Actions bot identity\n- **Release Workflow (release.yml)**: Changed from `release-bot@chronicle.dev` / \"Chronicle Release Bot\" to the official GitHub Actions bot identity\n\nThe new configuration uses:\n- Email: `41898282+github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com`\n- Name: `github-actions[bot]`\n\nThis is a best practice change that:\n1. **Improves transparency**: Commits are properly attributed to GitHub's automation system\n2. **Follows GitHub conventions**: Uses the standardized bot account format recognized throughout GitHub\n3. **Ensures consistency**: Both workflows now use the same identity for automated git operations\n\nThe change is low-risk as it only affects how commits are attributed in CI/CD processes. The workflows continue to function identically, but with more appropriate attribution for automated actions.",
